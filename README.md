# Hackaton2019
LASER-CGDV Hackathon 2020: Excluded from the work, Analysis of the labor situation of Venezuelans in Colombia 

LASER PULSE in collaboration with Purdue University, the University of Notre Dame, Universidad Nacional de Colombia, QED, The Center for Global Data Visualization (CGDV), Data Elevates, the Tableau, and USAID-Colombia invited us to participate in a data visualization hackathon. This event brought together teams of participants from Colombia and Indiana to demonstrate the power of open data for benefiting public knowledge and policy. Teams assessed, analyzed and visualized data and presented to an audience to communicate a recommendation, story, or new idea through data visualization. This allowed for better decision-making and more varied solutions to problems that span a wide range of global development challenges, such as the Venezuelan Migration Issue facing Colombia.
